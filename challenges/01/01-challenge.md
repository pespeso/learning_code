# Concat this

## Description

The first challenge. Just create two variables:
- `first_variable = hello`
- `second_variable = my dear`

_(name the variables whatever you want)_

and print their concatenation + current date.

### Input

Nothing from keyboard. You should use a package to get current date.

### Output

Something like

`hello my dear: 2020-07-27 14:35:34`

## Bonus points for:
- Format the date in spanish (i.e.: `%H:%M:%S â€“ %d-%m-%Y` instead of anything else. Please see [this](https://strftime.org/) for further information)

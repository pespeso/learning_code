# For the numbers!

## Description

Think about numbers. From zero to n (n âˆˆ [10, 1.000.000]). Sum all of them.

Now, get back from n to zero, this time with [step](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-range) = 2. Sum again.

What's the difference between both sums?

_Tip: `for` loops are your friends here_

### Input

You can ask the user for the n value. It is not required. But it is recommended.

### Output

Both partial sums and the total difference.

## Bonus points for:
- Think about doing something with random numbers. Or random steps.
- Could you measure how many time does this program take for long executions (i.e. n ~ close to a million). What happens if we x10 the value of n? And x100? How does this changes the execution time?

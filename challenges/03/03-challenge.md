# Consonants and vowels

## Description

Sometimes you need to extract some data from your information. Something basic like counting things.

Take a book, a long one: Don Quijote. [Here is a txt free version](http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2000/pg2000.txt) you can use in your script. Try to answer these questions:
- How many words are used in the book? How many _unique_ words (i.e. different words)?
- How many vowels ({a, e, i, o, u}) appear the book?
- How many times `Quijote` appear? And `quijote` (lowercase 'q')?

### Input

- A txt version of Don Quijote like [this one](http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2000/pg2000.txt)

### Output

- XXX words found
- XXX vowels found
- XXX appearances of 'Quijote'
- XXX appearances of 'quijote'

## Bonus points for:

- Could you create a top 100 list with the words that appear the most in the book? And for the least used?
